# Python-Fun-Games
This repository contains three interesting games that were developed as assignment solutions to MIT's OCW Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. Feel free to modify the games to suit your interests. These games were developed with **Python 3.9** Have fun!

## Hangman
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Simply open **hangman.py** and play!

## Word Game
This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words using their letters. Each valid word earns the user points, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word. Simply open **Word_Game.py** and play! 

## Cipher
Ever want to relive the glory days of your youth and pass secret messages to your friends? Well, here is your chance!
But first, here is some vocabulary: 
* Plaintext - the original message 
* Ciphertext - the encrypted message. Note: a ciphertext still contains all of the original message information, even if it looks like gibberish.

* Encryption - To encrypt a message, open **Cipher_B.py** and scroll to the bottom. Input your message as a **plaintext** object. The default message is **love**, and default encryption number is **3**
* Decryption - To decrypt your message, input encrypted message as a **ciphertext** object. The default encrypted message is **nqxg**. The game displays the decrypted message and decryption number. 
* **Cipher_C.py** allows you to encrypt a message by changing only the vowel letters in the message. Scroll to the bottom and input your message as a **message** object. The default message is **fruit**.
